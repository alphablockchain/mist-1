Elementrem Wallet

The Elementrem wallet, which allows you to create simple and multisig wallets to manage your element.

The wallet contains its own node, but can also use an already running one, if the IPC path of that node is the standard path.

As a general rule, Do not lose your password and keystore and Mist stores file. In any case, recovery is impossible. And it doesn't collect any personally identifiable information.
